# CHATBOT

This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that allows users to upload PDFs and ask questions based on the document's content. It extracts text, chunks it, embeds it, stores it in ChromaDB, retrieves relevant sections, and uses an LLM to answer grounded questions. The system is built with Python, LangChain, Chroma, OpenAI embeddings, and Gradio UI.
